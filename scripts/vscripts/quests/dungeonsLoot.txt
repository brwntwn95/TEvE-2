Twilight's Eve ORPG has a dungeon system that acts like a party system.
All you have to do is gather your "party members" outside a dungeon area and type |cffffcc00-enter|r, and it will transfer your party inside.
When you finally kill the final boss, you will be teleported to an Item Generator room where a random item will spawn for you;
its rarity and strength again depending on the difficulty of the dungeon. 
Once you've looted the item, type |cffff8c00-done|r to exit the room and be teleported to your last revival point.
If you die while fighting a dungeon, you will not be able to re-enter the dungeon until your former party members have all died/completed it.
They can also choose to exit the dungeon via the -out command, though.
|cffffcc00There are 5 types of Dungeon Difficulties|r:
|cff87ceebEasy|r
|Cff00ff00Hard|r
|cffff8c00Nightmare|r
|cffff0000Hell|r
|cffB22222Impossible|r

Twilight's Eve ORPG uses a random item generator interface when spawning items for players who complete a dungeon.
