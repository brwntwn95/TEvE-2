To choose a Profession, simply find a Profession Trainer of your preferred Profession and talk to him/her.
He/she will give you a simple "initiation" quest which you must complete in order to acquire your preferred Profession.

|cffff0000You can only choose ONE Profession. Your Profession and Profession Level are saved in your Hero Code so each Hero is binded to one Profession at any given time.|r

|cffffcc00To unlearn your current Profession, simply type -unlearn.
Doing so will reset your Profession Level back to 0, even if you re-learn the same Profession you unlearned before. 
You also have to redo the "initiation" quest again.|r

There are 5 Profession Ranks:

|Cff00ff00Journeyman|r - Levels 51-100
|cffffff00Expert|r - Levels 101-150
|cffff8c00Master|r - Levels 151-200
|cffff0000Legend|r - Levels 201-250

As you level your profession skills, you will hit a limit to which you can level.
In order to raise the limit, you must advance in profession rank.
Low rank advancement do not require you to do quests, but higher rank advancement such as "Master" and "Legend" will require you to do an advancement quest.
These quests usually take time and skill to do but opens up the max profession level cap along with a variety of benefits
