Type -save to save your codes. There will be 2 codes shown - your Hero code and your Item code, namely the first and second codes, respectively.
|cff87ceebThe First Save Code saves your character class, your experience, your position,
your Limit Break skill, Limit Break tier, Limit Break gauge meter, your profession and profession level, your abilities and what level they are.
Unspent skill points are also saved.|r
|cff87ceebThe Second Save Code saves only your PvP Points, gold, power shards, your items, their item charges and also your Personal Stash's items and their item charges.|r
Because of this, it is now available to freely use your 2nd Save Code on any character (provided they can use the items) so that you can transfer items freely in between characters,
and still have your PvP Points for PvP purposes.
There are 2 types of loads.
In order to load, type -load/-load2 ****-****-**** etc. You can only load |cffff0000ONCE|r.
Bear in mind that if you have any character in play or have any gold, it will auto replace them with your loaded character and gold.
|cffffcc00If you happen to have a PvP Rank at that time,
it will automatically change your player name back to your original username so that the save code binds to the correct player name.|r
