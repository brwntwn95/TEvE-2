In order to advance to your 3rd Job Class, you must first of all be a |cffffcc00Level 99|r 2nd Job Class in order to do so.
If you meet the requirements, then head to the City of New Lights and talk to your Class Trainer;
the very same one you talked to when you advanced to 2nd job. They will direct you to other "masters" of the your class,
in which you would have to choose which class you want to be. Finding these masters may or may not be easy depending on your Class,
as some are scattered around the map and some aren't.
Bear in mind that once you accept the advancement quest from a 3rd Job Class Trainer,
you can no longer revert to choosing your other path so choose wisely. However,
you can always load back your code if anything goes awry; quests are not saved.
|cffff0000You cannot save when you have a letter of recommendation.|r
