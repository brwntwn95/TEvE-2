The Thief is a pretty popular class, due to widespread rumours of it being able to kill extremely fast with amazing amounts of damage.
However, although the Thief does attack extremely fast, its attack damage is only moderate at best.
With low hp and low armor, the Thief, for all his fast hitting power, has to rely on dodging and critical strike skills to stay alive at low levels.
However, the Thief is a class well suited for melee support, and at later levels advance into a powerful soloist.
However, when faced with an extremely strong foe, the Thief would definitely require a tank.
When choosing later job upgrades, the Thief can choose to be an incredibly fast Assassin who specializes in critical strikes,
or a hidden, backstabbing Stalker who specializes in evasion.

Players wishing to be a Thief must be a level 10 Male Novice.
