What's there to say about the Swordsman? It is a classic character class; high hp, good armor, moderate attack damage, decent attack rate...
it is a very well-rounded character, adept at staying alive and tanking big bosses. However, for all its good points, it can never deal as much damage as the Templar
 Nor can it attack as fast as the Thief. The swordsman is a class that is better suited for tanking bosses rather than killing monsters swiftly.
 However, when the swordsman reaches higher job upgrades, he can opt for the Imperial Knight job upgrade, who focuses more on dishing out damage rather than on staying alive.
Players wishing to be a Swordsman must be a level 10 Male Novice.
