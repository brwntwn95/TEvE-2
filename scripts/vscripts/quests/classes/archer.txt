The Archer is a powerful ranged class. It deals pretty high damage at a decent attack rate.
The Archer's movement speed is also pretty decent enough for her to catch her opponents.
However, the Archer has very little armor and low hp. Hence, she is better as a ranged support unit rather than a tanking fighter.
When reaching higher job upgrades, she can become a swift tracker, or a powerful marksman.
At 4th Job, the Sniper becomes extremely capable at crowd control, while the Monster Hunter specializes in dishing out high damage to a single unit in a short amount of time.
Players wishing to be an Archer must be a level 10 Female Novice.
