You've seen the Swordsman. You've seen the Thief. You've seen the Mage. But have you really seen the Witch Hunter?
The Witch Hunters are another well-rounded class, with moderate hp, pretty decent attack speed and good attack damage.
Their skills are pretty adept at killing monsters but being well rounded also means they will not really have an advantage.
For example, their damage will never soar as high as the Templar, and their attack speed will never match the Thief's, not counting items.
However, when he changes into a Grand Inquisitor, he gains many auras which are very useful in a party, not to mention the Holy Repel skill,
which prevents bosses from casting nasty spells. This makes the Grand Inquisitor a favored class in parties.
If he chooses to change into a Professional Witcher instead, he gains a powerful passive cleave skill, not to mention the 36 Strikes skill which,
if used with the proper items, can deal more than 300,000 damage! However, the downside is that no matter which path he takes,
the Witch Hunter depends very heavily on good items in order to truly shine.

Players wishing to be a Witch Hunter must be a level 10 Male Novice.
