Acolytes are a different breed of healers. Even though they focus primarily on healing, their attacks are not weak. On the contrary, they are decent.
They have decent armor at best, and above average hp.
However, their attacks are slow and their skills focus entirely on healing and support, leaving them no way to kill creeps fast.
Hence, they are well suited for "lazy" players, or players who love to stand behind and support their team mates.
Acolytes aren't meant to solo, so they will encounter severe difficulties leveling in the beginning.
In most cases, the Acolyte class at low levels is forced to leech experience off other players.
Also, it should be known that a female acolyte has different stats from a male acolyte, but it is very minor as they progress at the same rate.
When changing jobs, they cannot choose their 3rd Job/4th Job Upgrade as it is based on their gender,
but it is at that period of time when their skill trees start to differ and branch out into Party Healing and Support, and Single Target Buff and Support.

Players wishing to be an Acolyte must be either a level 10 Female Novice, or a level 10 Male Novice.
