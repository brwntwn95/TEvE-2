The Druid is another class that offers much variation. It has below average damage and attack speed at the beginning, being a spellcaster,
but as the Druid progresses, he can choose to continue wielding the forces of nature, or attempt for the shapeshifting line.
However, the time when they truly shine is when they enter their 4th Job Upgrade. If they choose to become a Summoner,
they gain the power to summon various elemental powers to their side, like a powerful Tornado or a destructive Armageddon.
This dishes out high damage in a short amount of time, much like the Initiate class, only that they do not have a Mana Shield to protect against attacks.
Instead, they receive a regeneration skill that heals their life and mana over time, enabling them to stay indefinitely in combat, as long as someone tanks for them.
If they choose to become a powerful Runemaster, they gain even greater powers of the wild, and when they shapeshift into an Animal Form, their speed, armor,
and damage outputs increases by a large extent! To add on, they have passive damage skills that work whether they are in Animal Form or not,
thereby maximising their damage output potential regardless. Hence, these skills make the Druid class an outstanding class that can specialize in both offense and defense,
but still needs solid items to truly shine.

Players wishing to be a Druid must be a level 10 Male Novice.
