The Initiate is an apprentice learning the powerful arts of magic. Using magic, he can shape it into a ball of flame, or freeze enemies with a hailstorm.
The initiate is a classical magician, dealing damage in the form of elemental magics.
Although the initiate has low attack speed, next to no armor and extremely low hp,
he can deal amazing amounts of damage with his magics and he has pretty solid attack damage as well due to his high intelligence.
He is a good support character who, after job upgrades, can become a powerful soloist, not to mention gaining a very useful skill - Mana Shield, to offset his low hit points.
When he reaches 3rd job, he can choose to be a powerful Wizard, or an extremely adaptable Sage.
At fourth job, his class is able to cast the strongest spell in the game, though it is limited to only one of the 2 Job paths.
Players wishing to be an Initiate must be a level 10 Male Novice.
