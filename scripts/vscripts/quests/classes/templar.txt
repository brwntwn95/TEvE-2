The Templar class is probably the most fun class of all, not to mention it is actually one of my favourite classes.
The Templar has a skill set built for advancements. For example, if the player wishes to advance as a High Templar, he/she has to master the psionic arts skills.
Compared to other classes, this might be seen as a hassle, or as fun. However, whatever the case may be, the Templar's attacks are very strong.
This means that they are most probably the best boss killers in the game, since they deal incredible amounts of damage with every attack.
However, like all classes, there is a catch. The Templar has low attack speed, low hp, and little armor.
Some of these attributes will improve after changing into future job upgrades, but that is also the same with the other classes.
Hence, the Templar might be a good class for players who love to kill bosses. When changing to 3rd Job,
the player should master Psionic Arts if he wishes to change to a spellcasting High Templar.
If he wishes to advance as a powerful Dark Templar, he should master the warp blade arts.

Players wishing to be a Templar must be a level 10 Female Novice.
