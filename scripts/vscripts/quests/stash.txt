Now you can finally store items in your very own personal stash!
Furthermore, your stash can store any item, including items your character class can't use.
However, as items still bind on pickup, you cannot steal another player's item.
Your item code will save all items and their respective item charges carried by both your Hero and your stash, so make full use of this advantage.
Since PvP points are also saved separately as your Item code, it is possible to load2 without using the original -save.
This makes using the Item code a very good way to test PvP builds.
The stash also provides a good way to store items as well, so people can't destroy your items and whatnot
