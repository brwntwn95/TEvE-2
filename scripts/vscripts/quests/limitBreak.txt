Basically, the Limit Break System is a "Skill Point-based System", meaning that you can choose to put in a skill point into a particular Limit Break skill, which branches off to other lines as well like how it is with Job Changing, creating massive versatility and variation with your character.
As you take massive damage from monsters, your Limit Break gauge meter will start to fill slowly.
After it is completely full, you will gain the ability to use Limit Break.
As to which ability you will use, it will automatically unleash the latest Limit Break skill you have learnt.
The Limit Break System is branched off into Tiers, with Tier 1 Limit Break skills being the weakest.
