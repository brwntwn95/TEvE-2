In order to change to 2nd Job, first of all you need to be a |cffffcc00Level 40|r 1st Job Class in order to do so.
If you meet the requirements, then head to the City of New Lights and talk to your Class Trainer.
(for e.g. if you are an Archer, then talk to the Hunter) If you do not know who your Class Trainer is, then check F9 on your specific class;
your 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th jobs are all listed there. Once you talk to the Class Trainer,
they will give you an advancement quest that you need to complete. After completing the quest,
go back to your class trainer and right click on him/her, and you will successfully change your job.
Bear in mind, however, that you will start at Level 1 again, but this is minor because you will be very strong,
so leveling back would not pose much of a problem although it does take some time.
